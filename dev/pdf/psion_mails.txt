These are emails from an employee at Psion who worked on the 5mx and
provide some technical information. Thanks to Tony <tony@atomide.com> for
forwarding me these.

        be more specific.  what would you like to access?

        hard one, because i'm not too clued up on that aspect of base.  one
solution would be to install yourself as a "PartnerOS" - something EPOC
does have a provision for for the Philips smart phone of years ago.
documentation is very sparse though.

        hehehe boss and i wrote this bit :o)  protocol is basically YModem with
a few optional extras - i.e. any terminal program will be okay.  the
exact specifics of the S7 client is unknown to me as a contractor at
Enterprise wrote it (a perpetually up beat guy).

re:
---
> * ROM/RAM speeds

        varies according to machine _and_ when it was built in production
cycle.  i.e. early machines have flash and later we switch to mask ROM
(with a small patch flash, should it be needed).

        erm, it works...

        function spec for ETNA - i'll find out, whom you have to speak about
this or whether i can release this (quite possible, but remember to say
thank you).

re:
---
> --  PCMCIA slot/card
---
        functional spec for ASIC14 - ask Enterprise.

re:
---
> --  sound in/out, audio codecs
---
        5, 5mx and Revo, sound out is identical (same drivers used in fact). 
except on Revo, there's a slight pin move (can't remember what however,
it wasn't the buzzline).  Revo sounds record is obviously disabled...

        S7, go ask Enterprise...

re:
---
> --  screen
---
        Eiger and Windermere have similar, but certainly different LCD
controllers on board - you'll have to change you device driver.  i can't
give more details, because i don't know any more here - never worked on
that aspect.

re:

---
        ADC talks directly to main ASIC via SSP interface (changed on 5mx)

re:
---
> --  serial
---
        UARTs integrated on main ASICS.  Eiger only had one, Windy has two.

re:
---
> --  irda
---
        see the bit about UARTs - same UARTs used for RS232 and talking to
IRDA.

re:
---
> --  power management/monitoring
---
        hmm.  5, 5mx have voltmeters (same ADC as pointer).  Revo has dedicated
current counter, talks via GPIO to main ASIC with a very slow
asynchronous serial protocol.

re:
---
> --  timers
> * Which of these are the same as series5?
---
        same as before.

re:
---

---
        how many ports are going here?  the people to contact would be Psion
Enterprise as it's really more their turf.


re:
---
> * "ETNA" specs (this is the main ASIC, AFAIK)
---
        no, rubbish.  ETNA is a helper ASIC.  chip code names: Eiger,
Windermere and SA1100 (affectionately known as Sally), which correspond
to 5, 5mx and Revo, and S7 and Net book.

        you'll need the E32 tree, this comes with the OCK and DDK.  since i use
the OCK (something only available to licensees of Symbian), i wouldn't
know how to obtain a copy of the DDK from Symbian (other than asking
nicely, but i can't imagine that working when they inevitably ask why
you want it).  soz.  been speaking to bossman and it looks like you'll
have to become a Symbian licencee / partner - PSION can't help you here
because it will violate our agreement with the collective.



IF YOU'RE INTERESTED:
        if one individual is prepared to sign an NDA and many other evil
agreements (IPR etc) we have, i _might_ (not a promise, a lot of red
tape would have to be cleared and i'd have to speak to a lot of people)
be able to provide the full Windermere spec for free.

        however if a few people are London based, what may a more attractive
solution, a few members of the systems team could give a short seminar
or something along those lines, answering questions in person, giving
the vital information and so forth...

n.b. both these proposals have to be confirmed with other powers that
be.

        ETNA (aka ASIC12) is the _helper_ ASIC for Eiger (S5) and Windermere
(5MX).  it adds CF capabilities and some other gubbins.  basically it
adds more pins to the CPU.

re:
---

> this!)
---
        the S7 and NetBook uses ASIC14 (aka "that many legged bastard"), which
has nothing really in common with ETNA other than it was designed by the
same guy (and uses same VHDL for the timers, copy and paste is a
wonderful thing).  it's also a helper ASIC, the exact specifics i can't
be sure of because Enterprise have done a lot of developmental work on
it...
