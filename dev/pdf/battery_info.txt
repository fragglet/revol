The battery level(s) can be monitored using the auxilary channels of the ADC
for the touchscreen. Here are some emails which may be useful:

Well, it wasnt really specific code, I just hacked about with the adc
code. Currently it listens on the first 2 ports (which give the x, y
coordinate). If you change the following lines:

       ssi_transmit_data(dev,0xd000);
       ssi_transmit_data(dev,0x9000);

to

	ssi_transmit_data(dev,0xd000 | 0x2000);
	ssi_transmit_data(dev,0x9000 | 0x2000);

it ought to read the other channels (according to the adc datasheet
anyway, it didnt work so it may be that I'm totally wrong). I wrote a
small program to print the output from /dev/tpanel but I dont have it with
me right now - I adapted the picogui tpanel code.

gotcha..

i just tweaked the controlbytes in adc7843.c
 ssi_transmit_data(dev,0xa400); //channel 3
 ssi_transmit_data(dev,0xe400); //channel 4
and voila shows up the battery state on channel three.
it stays around 2593 when accus inserted and drops down to <20 (needs about
a 3 minutes).
i think there are some capacitors discharging slowly this might be faster
when the external powersupply is disconnected.
how do we get this into an own driver?

i  just measured the battery current.
its about 2.74V.
the adc reports about 2594 (maybe rough mV?)

Good news, this seems to work on my revo too. I found this slightly
surprising as the email tony quoted suggested the battery monitoring was
done differently. When charging, it seems to reach a maximum of around
3950 but drops to around 3500 when its finished. EPOC seems to use
3950-4000 as its "100%" value too - I get similar readings from its
battery monitor.

I also get ~2464 (invariant) from the other channel - presumably the
backup battery.

"with difficulty" :)

hi simon,

hmmm i dont have a backupbattery inserted and ch4  shows up ~4084.
i dont have one at hands for now, but tomorrow i ll try it.
did you try to remove the backup battery while watching the 4th channel?
(hey, its like tv :)
i really forgot about the backupbattery. i removed it 2 month ago and as id
never used epoc since than i never needed it.
