Revol is a Linux Distribution for the Psion Revo.
</p>

<p>
Please note: this is designed for the original Revo, although it
runs on the Revo+ as well. 
If you have a Revo+ or
a Diamond Mako, you may wish to try 
<a href="http://zeniiia.linux.org.uk/pub/distributions/revo/revolinux.nm.ru/">
this distribution</a> instead which makes use of the extra memory to fit
some useful things in. It will probably not run on the 5MX. If you have 
a 5MX, you may wish to try
<a href="http://www.psilinux.org/">the Psilinux project</a> which is
developing a distro.

</p>

<p>
Version 1.1 is <a href="download.html">available for download!</a>
I have managed to fit quite a few programs into the Revos memory.
Please feel free to try this out and send comments/suggestions/queries
to me.
</p>

<p>
Version 2.0 is under development and unlike previous versions will 
be package based using <a href="spkg.html">spkg</a>. You can browse
a list of packages <a href="pkgdesc/pkglist.html">here</a>.
